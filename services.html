                <h3 class="major">PetroPas Services</h3>
                <p><strong>PetroPas</strong> products are designed and optimized to get you to your pay zone. We perform among the best oilfield services in the industry and Petropas continues to set the bar for quality and reliability through proprietary technologies.</p>

                <p>We have a large fleet of fit-for-purpose fracturing equipment made for operations in Iran. The equipment uses the latest in electronics, motor and pump technology for reliable, effective and efficient treatments.</p>

                <br/><br/>
                <h3 class="major">1. Fracturing</h3>
                <h4>What is Fracturing?</h4>
                <p>Many formations are too tight to produce oil and natural gas, and require a stimulation process to extract the resources. In hydraulic fracturing, fluids carrying proppant are pumped into the ground with enough pressure to crack the rock. The proppant is left behind to hold open the cracks, while the fluid is flowed back allowing oil and gas the ability to flow to surface.</p>
                <h4>What is our solution?</h4>
                <p>Our leadership in fracturing services stems from the innovation we dedicate to our product and technology development, and the expertise we apply to the delivery of our services in the office and in the field. We make sure you have the fracturing solutions you need to get the most from your well safely and efficiently</p>

                <!-- #2: Coiled Tubing-->
                <br/><br/>
                <h3 class="major">2. Coiled Tubing</h3>
                <h4>What is Coiled Tubing?</h4>
                <p>Coiled tubing is a continuous length of steel pipe, spooled onto a large diameter reel. The pipe comes in a variety of sizes and can be run into any well. Coiled tubing is commonly used to convey tools, and circulate liquids and gases into and out of the wellbore without relieving the wellbore pressure.  </p>
                <h4>What is our solution?</h4>
                <p>Providing expert coiled tubing services, we have the reel and injector capacity to run to the bottom of wells that are more than 6,000 m (20,000 ft) deep. Each job is subject to technical analysis by our in-house engineers, including force analysis and hydraulic modeling. With the option to transmit data in real-time, our customers can monitor the well response to treatment and make changes on-the-fly to optimize performance.</p>

                <!-- #3: Acidizing and Production Enhancement -->
                <br/><br/>
                <h3 class="major">3. Adicizing & Production Enhancement</h3>
                <h4>What is Acidizing & Production Enhancement?</h4>
                <p>Acidizing and production enhancement operations increase or restore production in all types of wells. There are many different types of acid and solvent blends that can be used on a well, and treatments can be categorized by injection rate and pumping pressure. Treatments that are applied below fracture pressure are called matrix acidizing, while those carried out above formation pressure are called fracture acidizing.</p>
                <h4>What is our solution?</h4>
                <p>When it comes to improving or restoring production in a well, the best solutions come from a thorough investigation of the problem. Beginning with your formation, wellbore data and available wellbore samples, we gather information and study the issue from all angles. Using state-of-the-art equipment, our expert team designs a fit-for-purpose solution to address the problem and maximize resource recovery.</p>

                <!-- #4: Cementing -->
                <br/><br/>
                <h3 class="major">4. Cementing</h3>
                <h4>What is Cementing?</h4>
                <p>Cementing is one of the most important operations performed on a well in order to ensure complete zonal isolation, aquifer protection, and the structural integrity of the wellbore. Without it, the well may never reach its full production potential, and liquids from one zone could interfere with, or be lost to, another. After drilling a well, steel pipe - called casing - is inserted into the hole. Cement is then pumped down the pipe and circulated up the annulus to create a strong barrier of protection between the well and rock formations. </p>
                <h4>What is our solution?</h4>
                <p>Our greatest strength in cementing is our experience. We combine extensive technical and field knowledge with state-of-the-art tools, equipment, formulations, and ongoing research and development to give you the properties and the strength you need for zonal isolation and casing support.</p>

                <!-- #5: Well Intervention -->
                <br/><br/>
                <h3 class="major">5. Well Intervention</h3>
                <h4>What is Well Intervention?</h4>
                <p>Well intervention describes services provided during and after the completion of a well. These services include the stimulation of a targeted area or interval, as well as the removal of obstructions from the wellbore. </p>
                <h4>What is our solution?</h4>
                <p>Petropas provides specialized intervention tools to meet wellbore challenges. Drawing on our extensive experience in coiled tubing and our dedication to R&D, we offer fit-for-purpose tools to optimize reservoir performance. </p>
